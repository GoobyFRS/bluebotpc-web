## About Us

I started in Aurora, Colorado as a PC Repair shop in 2015 after Graduation. In 2022 we moved to Lone Tree, Colorado and built our first Point of Presents offering Game Server Hosting. As of July 1st 2023; we have relocated to North Dakota and are exploring our options for supporting this under-served community.

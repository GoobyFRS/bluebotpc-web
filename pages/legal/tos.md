# Terms of Service

From here onwards, BlueBotPC LLC will be referred to as “BBPC” or “Company” or "We".

**Dispatch Billing Transparency:** We do not bill for most Technician dispatch calls. Dispatch outside of our normal operating hours will result in a $125 Truck Roll fee.

**Communication Standards:** We prefers to communicate via Email. We can provide PGP keys for encrypted communications by request. This helps create a paper trail for us both!

**On-Site Support Statement:** Customers are responsible for maintaining a safe working environment for BBPC Technicians. Technicians may refuse service due to safety concerns. Our Technicians may wear a face-covering/mask upon request. Billable hours start once our Technician arrives at your address.

**Remote Support Statement:** Remote support is billed the same as on-site support. Some customer actions may be required during remote sessions to complete remote tasks.

**Billing Standards:** Electronic Invoices are sent via Square. Invoices over 30 days outstanding are subject to a $100 late fee. Invoices over 60 days old will be sent to collections. Customer Orders over $1,000 will require a non-refundable 20% deposit. Disputes can be negotiated with Matt.

**Final Amendment:** We have Industry experience, certifications, and education. We will make the best judgement call on a case by case basis. All problems and concerns can be resolved by communicating with Matt.

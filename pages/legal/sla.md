# Service Level Agreement

BlueBotPC LLC shall use all reasonable commercial efforts, being no less than accepted industry standards to ensure that your BlueBotPC LLC service is available to you (the Customer) 99.98% of the time in any given calendar month. If not, you may be eligible for Customer Service Credits described below.

## Definitions

The following definitions shall apply to the BlueBotPC LLC Service Level Agreement for **Managed WordPress** customers.

**Server** shall be defined as a Linode LLC system on which a Customer Service resides.

**Monthly Uptime Percentage** means the total number of minutes in the calendar month minus the number of minutes of Downtime suffered from all Downtime Periods in the calendar month, divided by the total number of minutes in the calendar month. Months are billed and calulated in 28 day periods.

**Server Downtime** is that when a the machine is in an booted state and that the IP address the Customer Service is attached to does not respond to ping tests or TCP port tests from other systems in the BlueBotPC LLC network. This indicates the Customer Service is unreachable.

**Emergency Downtime** means situations where BlueBotPC LLC must temporarily induce downtime on a Server for events such as hardware failure, vulnerability repairs, and other such situations requiring the immediate shutdown of the system. Emergency Downtime is not considered Downtime for the purposes of this agreement.

**Scheduled Downtime** refers to situations where BlueBotPC LLC will inform you of periods of downtime prior to the application of the Downtime. Scheduled Downtime is not considered downtime for the purposes of this agreement. You will be informed through the email address associated with your Customer Service Account.

### Customer Service Credits will be provided according to the following schedule

**Customer Credit:** Includes a 30:1 service credit added to your account credit balance, if your Monthly Uptime Percentage for any given calendar month is below 99.98%.
This implies that for every 1-minute of downtime, we credit 30 minutes to your account.

Customer Must Request Credit. In order to receive any Customer Service Credits described above, you must notify BlueBotPC LLC by email or otherwise in writing within twenty-eight (28) days from the time you become eligible to receive a Customer Service Credit. _I will in-best-effort credit your account without your input._

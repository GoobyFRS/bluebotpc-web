## Support Billing

All repairs that require in-depth troubleshooting are subject to an non-refundable **$40.00 Diagnostics Fee**. This covers 2 hours of troubleshooting time. Work requiring more than 2 hours is subject to a **$50.00 per hour flat rate** after the diagnostics time has ended. Customer Orders over $1,000 will require a non-refundable 20% deposit. Disputes can be negotiated with Matt.

**Dispatch Billing Transparency:** We do not bill for most Technician dispatch calls. Dispatch outside of our normal operating hours will result in a $125 Truck Roll fee. Customer Orders over $1,000 will require a non-refundable 20% deposit. Disputes can be negotiated with Matt.

**On-Site Support Statement:** Customers are responsible for maintaining a safe working environment for BBPC Technicians. Technicians may refuse service due to safety concerns. Our Technicians may wear a face-covering/mask upon request. Billable hours start once our Technician arrives at your address.

**Final Amendment:** We have Industry experience, certifications, and education. We will make the best judgement call on a case by case basis. All problems and concerns can be resolved by communicating with Matt.

### Repair Process

1. **Drop-Off / Free Consultation:** We visually inspect your computer for damage, talk to you about your experience, and perform basic troubleshooting.
1. **Troubleshooting Desk:** The Laptop Battery undergoes a  software diagnostics workflow to ensure the battery is defective and we collect information to order the replacement.
1. **Repair:** The replacement battery is installed and cleanup work is performed.
1. **Return to Customer:** Device is removed from inventory, payment is processed, and receipt is given.

### What We Need From You?

- Your login credentials - If you have BitLocker or any passwords set on the computer (BIOS, login, etc.) please provide these (all of them).
